It all started when our uber geek, Bill Brasky, woke up in a swamp. It was the second time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously worried, Bill Brasky backhanded a ninja star, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Heart filled with earnest fortitude, he realized that his beloved iPad was missing! Immediately he called his former lay, Leroy Jenkins. Bill Brasky had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) 550,000 years, the majority of which were enticing ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was ingenious though sometimes a little... stupid. Bill Brasky called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.
Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very sad Bill Brasky. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most legless puppies shudder before mating, yet long-haired sea monkeys usually charismatically cringe *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Bill Brasky. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Bill Brasky? Because he had snuck out from Bill Brasky's with the iPad only eight days prior. It was a electric little iPad... how could he resist?
It didn't take long before Bill Brasky got back to the subject at hand: his iPad. Leroy Jenkins cringed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the iPad. Bill Brasky grabbed his George Foreman grill and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the iPad and he had to do it aptly. He figured that if Bill Brasky took the tricked out go kart, he had take at least six minutes before Bill Brasky would get there. But if he took the Segway? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.
Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by six funny-smelling marmots that were lured by his iPad. Leroy Jenkins yawned; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling angered, he recklessly reached for his gerbil and aggressively attacked every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the fanstic pumpkin patch, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the Segway rolling up. It was Bill Brasky.
